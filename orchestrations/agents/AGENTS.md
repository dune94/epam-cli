## Specification Agents

- **spec-coordinator-agent** — Chooses which specification personas (OpenSpec, Speckit, or both) run before every estimate/execution cycle. Updates `stories[].specification` metadata so dashboards and automations can audit each run.
- **openspec-agent** — Refines acceptance criteria and proposes deterministic splits; outputs strictly structured JSON so spec-mode automation can apply diffs to `prd.json`.
- **speckit-agent** — Complements OpenSpec with broader system coverage, cross-story dependencies, and regression notes using the same structured schema.

Every future project must keep these three roles registered in `orchestrations/agents/profiles.json` so specification-first orchestration is always available.
